# Session/Break Timer

This web app helps you schedule your productivity time with adjustable work sessions and break sessions. The default is 25 minutes for the session and 5 minutes for the break. The lengths of each of these range from 1 to 60 minutes which are changed by the "-" and "+" buttons next to their respective lengths. Once the timer reaches 0, a brief beep will play and seamlessly switch to the next timer. This goes on infinitely unless you pause or reset the timer. Adjusting the timer while it is still going will also cause the timer to change in that moment and continue counting down from the new number.
